## The software process

* A structured set of activities required to develop a software system
* Many diff process but all involve
  * specification
  * Design and implementation
  * Validation - testing
  * Evolution - changing software with changing customer needs
* A software process model is an abstract representation of a process. It presents a description

## Plan-driven and agile processes

* Plan-driven processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan
  * This will not help release things fast
* In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements
  * release early and release often.
  * linux is entirely agile and very successful
  * open source software
* In practice, most practical processes include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches
* There are no right or wrong software processes
  * "It depends"

## Software process models

* The waterfall model
  * Plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development
  * take this and this and integrate them
  * integrated config
  * it's NOT straight up software dev
  * even when you do this you still need to have a plan
* Incrmental development
  * Specifcation
* Integration and config
  * The system is assembled from existing config components
* In practice, S/E uses all these models

## Waterfall model

* never go backwards in steps, except after release
* Requirements definition
  * system and software design
    * Implementation and unit testing
      * Integration and sys testing
        * Operation maintenance
          * __NOW WE CAN GO BACK__
* Slow

## Incremental Dev

* Outline
  * Specification
    * Initial Verison
  * Dev
    * Intermediate version
  * Validation
    * Final Version
* Advantages
  * Fast
  * more and frequent feedback
* Disadvantages
  * Hectic
  * Can't see the forest through the trees
  * Feature creep
  * more code and it turns into hard to understand design

## Integration and Configuration

* Buying as much stuff as possible
* Based on software reuse where systems are integrated from existing components or application systems
* Reused elements may be configured to adapt their behavior and functionality to a user's requirements
* Reuse is now the std approach for building many types of business system
  * Reuse convered in more depth in Chapter 15.
