## Chapter 5 cont.

Acitivity model - What happens in the data flow? This explains it.

## Order Processing

Sequencing Model - predefining the system that must happen

* Time goes down the y-axis

## Event-driven modeling (Programming)

* Real-time
* minimal data processing
* shows how system responds
* based on finite states and events (stimuli)
  * transition between states at ANY time.

## State Diagram of a microwave oven

* states with std arrows
* finite automata class
* it may not end
  * constant loop of states
* lookup tables are used often
  * FA class here again

NOTE: These diagrams have little to no discussion to explain things further

## Model-driven engineering

## Chapter 6: Architectural Design

* Architectural design decision
