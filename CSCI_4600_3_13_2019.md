## Talking about the software engineering class diagram

* Use aggregation, implementatiion. Don't use the association relationships
* Due Monday
* Keep the diagram in sync with the code

## Tips

* Nouns and ajective often suggest a class
* verbs suggest methods (functions)
  * actions that do something
* Use inheritance
* If you need to read/write files, classes based around the file
  * saving user data
  * create new save state
* We should see about 10 classes

## Chapter 5 - System Modeling

UML diagram types

* Activity diagrams, which show the activities involved in a process or in data processing.

Using Graphical models

* talk about it
  * incorrect and incomplete is OK, open to discuss
* document a system
  * accurate but needs not be complete
* detailed systems to generate implementation
  * both correct and complete

Context Models

* How and where the system will operate
* social and organizational concerns nay affect the decision on where to position system boundaries.
* Architectural models show the system and its relationship

System boundaries

* Set up to define what is outside and inside system
  * They show other systems that used for depend on the system
* Position has profound effect
* Defining it is political judgement
  * decision to increase or decrease workload on specific parts

## Process Model of involuntary detention

* arrows show flow of information
* the *bars*
  * things happening in parallel

## Interaction Models

* Modeling user interaction uis important as it helps to identify user requirements
* Modeling system-to-system interaction highlights problems that might arise
* Modeling component interaction helps us understand system dependability
* Use case diagrams and sequence diagrams may be used for interaction modeling

## Use case modeling

* high level
* useless
* idea is actors that can be other systems as well as people

## Table desc

* function and term descriptions

## Sequence diagrams

* part of UML
* diagram interactions
