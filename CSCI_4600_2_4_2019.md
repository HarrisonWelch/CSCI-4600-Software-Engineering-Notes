Elaboration - Requirements
Due this Friday at 11:00
50 points

## Software stuff

You may think your elaboration is good enough, but you can always explain yourself better

## Process

* Requirements elicitation and analysis: getting tasks from user
  * Requirements specification
    * Requirements validation
      * Requirements documents
    * User and system requirements
  * system descriptions

## Software specification

* The process of establishing what services are required a the constraints on the system's operation and development
* Requirements
  * Requirements elicitation and analysis
    * What do the system stakeholders require
  * Req specification
  * What should the brakes on a car do as opposed to the accelerator?

## General model of the design process

* Personal data is heavily protected
* Timing
* Security
* ERD = entitiy relation diagram
* Design
  * input
  * activity
  * output

## System Implementation

* The software is implemented either by dev a program or programs or by configuring an application system
* Design and implementation are interleaved activities for most types of software system
* Programming is an individual activity

## Software Validation

* Verification and validation (V & V) is to check if the product meets requirements
* review by system testing
* System testing involves executing the system with test data design after all user applications
* Tsting is most common in V&V activity

## Stages of Testing

1. Component Testing
2. System testing
3. acceptance testing

NOTE: Can go back to step 1.

## System evolution

* Define system requirements
* Assess existing systems
  * Existing systems
* Purpose system changes
* Modify systems
  * New System

## Coding with change

* Change anticipation, where the software is prepared to be changes
* Change tolerance, how much can software change before needing a rework

## Coping with changing reqs

* Prototype the thing
  * Bob would test with his/her responses
* Incremental delivery
  * update
  * AGILE DEV (NOT WATERFALL)
