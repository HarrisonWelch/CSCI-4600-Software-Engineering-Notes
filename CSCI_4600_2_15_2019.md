## Functional Requirements

* High level

## Requirements completeness and consistency

* Complete
  * desc of all facilities
* Consistent
  * There should be no conflicts or contradictions in the descriptions of the system facilities

## Non-functional

* constraints
  * Windows 10 OS
  * I/O ability
  * system representations
    * You must support voice, you must support mouse
    * Terminal program
    * GUI
    * Voice app
  * "Had to pass TEMPEST"
    * less radiation from coaxial TVs
* process
  * PyCharm IDE
  * prog lang
* more critical somtimes, if not met the system may be useless

## Types of non-functional req

* Non-functional
  * Product
    * Usability
    * Efficiency
      * Performance
      * Space
    * Dependability
      * "Amazon goes down and kills the internet"
      * "Use Unix b/c its always up"
    * Security
  * Organizational
    * Environment
    * Operational
    * Development
  * External
    * Gov regulations
    * Ethics
      * "don't read private info"
    * Legislative
      * Accounting
      * Safety/security
        * "don't blow up and kill people"

## Requirements engineering processes

* The process used for RE vary widely depending on the application domain, the people involved and the organization dev the requirements
* However, there are a number of generic activities

## A spiral view of the requirements engineering process

* Diagrams!
* "when I was in grad school I had to read a huge

## Requirements elicitation

* Sometimes called requirements elicitation or requirements discovery
* Involves technical staff
* may involve end-users, managers, engineers
  * __Stakeholders__

## Requirements elicitation 2

* "People don't know what they want"
* peeps express in thier words
* Diff stackholder reqs may conflict
  * raising fees are positive for finance, but bad for customer appeal
* Organizational and political factors influence reqs
  * Congress can change everything
* The reqs change during analysis
  * After done then congress comes in with regulations

## Interviews in practice

* Normally a mix of closed and open-ended interviewing
* Interviews are good for getting an overall understanding
* Interviewers must be open-minded
* prompt the use to talk

## Problems with interviews

* Not technical, open-ended
* App specialists may use language to desc thier work that isn't easy for req engineers to understand
* not good for understanding domain requirements
  * engineers may not get the lingo
  * some knowledege is so familiar that you can't explain it.

## Ethnography

* "shadowing"
* Social scientist observes how they work
* People do not have to explain or articulate
* social and organizational factors of importance

## Stories and scenarios

* Scenarios and user stories of what they do

## Scenario

* A structured form of user story
* Scenarios
  * starting situation
  * desc of the normal flow
  * desc of what can go wrong
  * info about other concurrent
  * desc of the state when done

## Requirement lagnuage

* Natural lang
* Structured nat lang - written in certain way but in common speak
* Design desc lang
  * set program syntax for saying things
* graphical
  * state chart
* math specification

## Req and design

* In principle, state what the system should do
* In practice, requirements and design are inseperable

## Next time: UML

* way to produce documentation for a project
